    <h2>What Is a Disciple Scholar?</h2>
    <p>A disciple scholar is always willing to learn and serve. It is someone who learns because they enjoy the light of Christ. A disciple scholar seeks out opportunities to do good to others.</p>
    <p>In Univ 101, we read Patricia T. Holland’s Talk, “An Eye Single.” In this talk, sister Holland talked about how D&C 88:67 helped her get over her fear of public speaking by making the Lord her primary concern. Since the Lord was her primary concern, she didn’t worry so much about what other people thought about her. She could just continue knowing that she was doing the correct thing. I can employ a similar strategy in school by keeping my heart turned towards the Savior. Through this, I will be less daunted by my homework. I will know that God will provide me light if I rely on Him. When He is our ultimate goal, we gain more resolve and an ability to do whatever He commands us to do. A similar approach can be taken in my professional life. If I am truly focused on him, then I will be able to do everything I need to press forward. This doesn’t always mean that it will be easy, but it does mean that I will have the mental strength to go through my trials. This is an important part of striving to become a disciple scholar: to study and focus on God.</p>
